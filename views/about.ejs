    <h1>ABOUT PAGE</h1>
    <p>In the context of the Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG), the hierarchy typically follows this structure:

        Series: This term is not commonly used in the Pokémon TCG hierarchy. Instead, the overarching term used is "Generation" or "Block," which encompasses multiple expansions released over a period of time under a common theme or storyline. Each Generation or Block may contain several expansions and sets.
        Expansion: An expansion is a major release within a Generation or Block. It consists of multiple sets, promotional cards, and additional products. Expansions often introduce new Pokémon, gameplay mechanics, and themes related to the Pokémon video games or other media.
        Set: A set is a specific group of cards released together under the umbrella of an expansion. Each set has its own unique name, set symbol, and numbering system for cards. Sets include Pokémon cards, Trainer cards, Energy cards, and sometimes special subsets or themes within the expansion's overall theme.
        So, the correct hierarchy is typically:
        
        Generation/Block (Series) > Expansion > Set
        
        For example:
        
        Generation/Block: Sword & Shield Series
        Expansion: Sword & Shield: Darkness Ablaze
        Sets: Sword & Shield Base Set, Sword & Shield: Rebel Clash, Sword & Shield: Darkness Ablaze (sets within the expansion)
        This hierarchy helps organize the releases within the Pokémon TCG and provides a framework for players, collectors, and enthusiasts to understand the chronological and thematic progression of the game's card releases.</p>
